# Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting health-related conditions using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, clustering, and classification tasks implemented in Python via Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- `Sub-task1.ipynb`: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `Sub-task2.ipynb`: Feature reduction and clustering.
- `Sub-Task3.ipynb`: Classification models and evaluation.
- `cars_reduced.csv`, `cluster.csv`, `stroke-data.csv`: Datasets used for analysis.

## Features

- Data cleaning and visualization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Unsupervised learning (clustering)
- Supervised learning (classification)
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Datasets

The datasets include health-related metrics such as demographic information, medical conditions, and lifestyle features. These are used to predict stroke or cancer risk factors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alimoghiman-78/cancer-prediction
   cd cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebooks in order:
   - `Sub-task1.ipynb`
   - `Sub-task2.ipynb`
   - `Sub-Task3.ipynb`
